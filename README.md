#### Mobile info

When running the mobile app in dev mode this will start a local webserver on your machine.
The mobile app will try to connect to this; this allows for faster testing and development on the mobile platform so you won't need to rebuild and test.
chrome://inspect will allow you to inspect any errors from google on your desktop.

#### Mobile Development

Make sure to update the script in the header with your local IP - 
```
